# Problem Statement
We are given the data of covid-19 patients, having number of deaths, confirmed, recovered, and active cases of different countries for a certain period of time.
we are writing the code to do the exploratory data analysis and visualizations to analyze the trend of confirmed cases and as well as makie the predictions about the number of cases expected a week in the future based on the current trends.

# Project

In this project, we used pandas to acculamate and analyse the data,
used plotly library to create interactive visualizations, used facebook prophet library to make time series models and forecasting the numbers for next week, and visualized the prediction by combining these technologies.



# Prophet
Prophetis a time series forecasting tool developed by Facebook that's designed to be easy to use and effective for a wide range of time series data. It's particularly useful for data that has strong seasonal effects (like daily or weekly patterns) and includes important dates or events that can impact the forecast.
